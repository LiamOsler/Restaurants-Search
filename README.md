## Executive Summary 

We will develop an application that will be the “Trivago of Food” – a website that compares food delivery services and presents the best prices to the user. The name of our product is “FoodFeed”. We believe that we will be able to both help consumers save money on food while earning profits through business-to-business sales, advertising, and an optional tipping system.  

## Problem 

There are dozens of third-party food delivery services like UberEats, DoorDash, GrubHub - in some cases restaurants may even use multiple delivery services. Currently, if a consumer wants to compare the final price of an order on multiple delivery services, they must go through the tedious process of finding the restaurant on each platform and proceeding through their respective checkout processes. The amount of effort required in doing this discourages many consumers from price-shopping items on different platforms and can result in them paying more than needed. 

## Proposed Solution 

Our proposed solution is to develop a web platform that allows consumers to compare the prices of their order across multiple delivery services. The platform will have a server-side backend that will fetch the availability, price and expected delivery times.  When visiting the website or using the mobile app, the user will be presented with a search menu where they will be able to look for either a menu item, restaurant, or location. The user will add items to a cart, just like they would in a typical delivery app. Once the items are selected, Food Feed will show them a comparison of the final checkout prices (including delivery fees, service charges, etc.) and factors like the expected delivery time and reviews would also be displayed. If an item is unavailable through a delivery service, but available on another, this will be indicated to them. The user can then complete the order using their information saved on the FoodFeed platform.
